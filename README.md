# matrixOperations
Common matrix operations implemented in prolog (tested with ECLiPSe 6.1)

Implemented 

* Sum
* Difference, implemented also as a constraint
* Product
* Transpose
* Trace
* Diagonal
* Antidiagonal
* Determinant (only for a 2X2 and 3X3 matrix), implemented also as a constraint
* Size
* Identity
* Nth row
* Nth column
* Scalar multiplication, implemented also as a constraint
* Switch row
* Switch column
* Eigenvalues (only for a 2X2 and 3X3 matrix)
* Print matrix

Still a lot to do...
